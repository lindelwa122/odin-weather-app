![Weather App Previous](./src/images/weather-preview.png)

This is a weather app that shows you the temperature of your city in Celsius or Fahrenheit (whatever you prefer). It shows you the day's highlights and forecast for the next three days.

## The purpose of the project

The goal of this project was to create a compact weather app, honing my skills with **APIs**. Going beyond the basic requirements, I utilized the dom wizard to build the application, giving me a chance to reinforce **OOP design principles**. A key observation during the development was the need for additional functionalities in [**dom wizard**](https://github.com/lindelwa122/dom-wizard) to facilitate automatic page updates when there are changes in store properties. This realization stemmed from the acknowledgment that manually updating the UI when data changes can be a tedious task.
